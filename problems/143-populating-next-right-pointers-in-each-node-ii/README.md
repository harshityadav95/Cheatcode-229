# 143. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

- LeetCode: 117
- Pattern: Tree DFS
- Difficulty: Medium
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(h)
- Python: `code.py` (`populating_next_right_pointers_in_each_node_ii`)
- Go: `code.go` (`Solve143`)

## Problem Statement

Populate each node's next pointer to its neighbor on the same level, or null if none, in any binary tree.

## Example

- Input: `root=[1,2,3,4,5,null,7]`
- Output: `levels linked as 1->null, 2->3->null, 4->5->7->null`
- Why: Next pointers connect across each level.

## Clarify Before Coding

- Empty or singleton input?
- Mutate input or build output?
- Duplicate/tie behavior?
- int vs int64 in Go?
- Exact return shape?

## Approach

### Intuition

return subtree fact... When dfs returns, that subtree fact is final.

### Brute Force Baseline

For each node, recompute subtree facts from scratch; can become O(n^2).

### Optimized Approach

Postorder or preorder DFS carries exactly the state needed by children/parent. Alternative: Iterative stack avoids recursion depth; BFS works when level order matters.

### Invariant

When dfs returns from a node, its subtree answer/fact is final.

### Proof Sketch

Initialize state so the invariant is true. Each update preserves it using finalized information only. At the end, every candidate was considered or safely discarded. Complexity reason: Each node is visited once: O(n) time. Recursion stack is O(h).

## Edge Checklist

nil root; skewed tree recursion depth; negative values; duplicate values; global vs returned answer.

## Common Mistakes

- Returning answer instead of path contribution; wrong null base case.
- Updating state before saving the next pointer/index.
- Recording an answer while the window/state is invalid.
- Forgetting nil/empty/base cases.

## Implementation Checkpoints

- Define the exact state before coding.
- Update state in one place.
- Dry run the sample before typing loops.
- Say why discarded candidates cannot later win.

## Follow-up Drills

- Return the nodes on the path, not just a count/value.
- Make the tree contain negative values or duplicate values.
- Convert recursive DFS to iterative stack DFS.

## Follow-up Questions

- Can you write iterative DFS? What value does each call return?
- What changes if constraints are 10x larger?
- Which line would you unit-test first and why?
